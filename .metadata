[b]To use any custom race, you need to install mods that extend your species selection screen.[/b]
One example of a fitting mod would be [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729426722]Xbawks Character Extender.[/url]
  
The most recent patch of this SHOULD be stable, I wasn't able to reproduce any earlier issues anymore.
  
Adds the Dreemurrers (Undertale/Deltarune Goat Bossmonsters) as a playable race to Starbound.
Currently heavily Work in Progress. Missing a few textures (you'll notice first with the Sword), and missing Codexes.
We currently have implemented the player textures and new tiered ships.
  
Seriously, expect this mod to be buggy.
  
If you encounter a bug, please, if you can, provide a crash log, or a detailed explanation of what you have done.
You can find the crashlog in your steamapps\\common\\Starbound\\storage\\starbound.log.
  
We're somewhat new to Starbound modding, we need all the help we can get.
Thank you.
  
also, I added a very bodgy discord server where you can help me with this very bodgy mod like add bug reports and stuff
