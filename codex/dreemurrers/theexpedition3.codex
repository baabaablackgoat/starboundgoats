		"I still do not know if our overall despair was greater or lesser when our crew finally returned after two years.\n \nTheir ship was overgrown with strange plants of distant worlds, and the crew members shambled out of the ship, looking torn between disbelief and resignation.

War became the constant of Earthly society. I wonder how humanity had not ended its sad existence much, much longer ago.",
		
		"But what truly horrifies me is that humanity survives to create ever more terrible methods of (self-)destruction.\n \nIt was a war of swords and slings in the beginning, and what did they have by the end? Explosive devices that could end two million lives in one fiery blink. Airborne poisons that turn the victim’s insides into liquid. Projectiles engineered to completely tear apart a human’s body..."
